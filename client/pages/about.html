                    The phrase “food for all”, is often attributed to zero hunger; but its relevance extends to
                    alleviating
                    shortage
                    of
                    food, reducing malnutrition, and bridging the gap between scarcity and surplus.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In a society abundant with resources, the unsettling paradox of excessive wastage of food further
                    aggravates
                    the
                    causes of hunger and the myriad of associated issues.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This presents a pressing concern to address challenges intertwined with hunger and an opportunity to
                    ensure
                    everyone stays nourished.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In this context, QUAD.B aims to not only provide a solution to reduce food wastage and optimize the
                    quantity
                    of
                    raw
                    materials to be purchased based on consumers, but also a medium to redistribute unprocessed or
                    processed
                    items
                    between stores, restaurants, and any entity in the ‘consumable products’ sector and facilitate in
                    clearing
                    items
                    closer to expiration to those in need.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    From mitigating wastage to providing food at inexpensive rates much lower than market price as well
                    as a
                    provision
                    of free-of-charge resources, our work seeks to ensure optimal resource utilization and contribute
                    to the pursuit of zero hunger.
